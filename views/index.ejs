            Our objective is to provide carefully planned stimulating environments, which help children, develop essential habits, attitudes, skills and ideas for a lifetime of creative thinking. Montessori's philosophy of following the growing needs of each individual child, gives children the freedom to experiment and learn in a "prepared environment" at their own pace in a noncompetitive atmosphere. This allows the physical, intellectual, emotional and social potential of each child to unfold.

                Welcome to Happy Tots Montessori Schools where our passion for education shows in each child’s joyful eyes, in each teacher’s inspiring voice, and in each classroom’s inviting warmth. Visit one of our campuses and you will see how we are more than just a daycare or a traditional private school. Our mission is to equip students, from infant through 8th grade, with Knowledge for Life –  the essential knowledge, thinking skills, and strength of character required to flourish as joyous children today and as successful adults tomorrow. Starting with authentic Montessori for infants and progressing to a rigorous Montessori upper school curriculum, our students become well prepared for a life-time of personal and academic success.
