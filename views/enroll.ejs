A visit is the only way to really find out whether a school is right for you. We typically schedule tours in the mornings, so you can see the authentic Montessori experience in practice (as against seeing empty classrooms).</p>

			<p>Near-term and mid-year enrollment. We enroll year-round when there is a match between a spot and a child (timing, age, gender, previous Montessori experience, language skills, etc.) If there’s a match between your child, your timeline, and an opening, you may receive an enrollment offer during or soon after your tour.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>Waitlist for school-year starts and future mid-year openings. If you are planning ahead or looking to enroll for the next school year, you can place your child on our waitlist/applicant pool via the simple online process. You’ll receive a link to the waitlist after your tour. The sooner you waitlist, the higher up on the waitlist you will be, so act now. Enrollment offers for the next school year are typically sent out between February and April; after April, if any spots remain open, we will offer direct enrollment for the next school year.</p>

	<h3 class="text-center">Step 3: Enrollment</h3>
	<p class="text-center">For all children, once you complete the enrollment application and pay the tuition deposit to secure your spot, you need to complete an enrollment package. It covers items ranging from food preferences to vaccination reports and emergency contact and pick-up authorizations.</p>
